### Questions Answered within gene_analyzer:
**What is the GC-content value of the Human Gene CD28?:** 39.97%.
**What is a fasta file?:** Text file representing nucleotides where single letters represent aminoacid paris.
**What happens if there are multiple sequences in the fasta file?:** Biological computation (e.g.) tools can process each separate sequence marked by a header ">".
**What happens if the fasta file is invalid?:** Errors or Warnings.
**What happens if there are upper case and lower case letters in the sequence?:** Depending on the Biological computation tool, they might be treated with no case difference.
**Where to download a sequence for a human gene?:** https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene?Db=gene&Cmd=DetailsSearch&Term=940.
